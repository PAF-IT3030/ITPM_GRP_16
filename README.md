SDG â€“ PEACE JUSTICE AND STRONG INSITUTION 

The primary objective of this digital platform is to provide an opportunity for abused children to present their problems online. Basically, you can present your problem under 4 types of grants: Physical Abuse, Mental Abuse, Sexual Abuse, and Other. Users can choose which of these four types of violence users have suffered and contact the relevant parties. After submitting the user problem, an expert can be contacted for it. For example, legal action can be taken if the user has faced physical abuse. If further assistance is required, it can be done by system administrators.
